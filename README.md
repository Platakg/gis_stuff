## Scripts to convert CSV to Shapefile in Python
Using ACLED for test data, I use the pyshp module to read in a csv to shapefile format. <br>

Core script: acled_proj/convert2shp.py

## Improvements
Improvements need to be made in order to make point attributes dynamic so that the script will be compatible across other csv files.
